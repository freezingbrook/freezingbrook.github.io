It is common knowledge that Greece is at the heart of a crisis. Let us confront this as an economic crisis, though it has major consequences on the entirety of the Greek society.

Essentially, we need economic growth in order to overcome the crisis. What better way to do this than to create a company, based in Greece of course. Let us assume that you are a young agriculture graduate and you decide to create a web-based startup selling flowers that you cultivate in your croft.

The course of action to accomplish this, assuming you have a croft and the know how, encompasses the following actions:

* Getting state permissions to grow flowers in your croft
* Starting up. Steps this act includes:
	* A [seal](http://www.kretsis.com/print/images/uploads/sfragida4.jpg) with yours and your jobs details
	* An income/expenses book, which you numerate
	* A three-layer receipt book, which you numerate and seal each page
	* A three-layer invoices book, which you numerate and seal each page
	* Five copies of your government ID
	* Apply using specific forms, validated from an authority. These are:
		* Two for your official business office
		* One that you have not endorsed at any other Public Economic Department office of the city or country
		* One that you have no employees
	* A table of the tax codes domains that your company will do business in
	* Forms that validate your insurance
	* Pre-registration at the chamber of your profession, e.g. Chamber of Commerce
	* Pre-registration at the insurance domain, according to your profession. This includes multiples forms and an 'inventory contribution', around â‚¬100
	* Registration at the tax domain office. Includes submitting one new form, two of the confirmation forms that you get at previous steps of the process, and receiving a confirmation
	* Complete registration at your profession's insurance domain now that you have confirmation from the tax domain office
	* Complete registration at the chamber of your profession now that you have confirmation from the tax domain office
	* Final endorsement of your books and blocks at the Public Economic Department


After those steps you will be happy with your new company. Soon, though, you will have to pay your taxes. These calculations do not include VAT (value added tax).

These include:

* 2700 euro for healthcare
* 26% of your income except healthcare
* 100% of tax payment in advance for future years
* 2% solidarity

So, assuming this is your first year in business and you have 10,000 euro total revenue.

10,000 - 2,700 = 7,300 pre-taxes  
26% = 1,898  
100% of tax = 1,898  
2% = 146  

Which leaves a net income of 3,358 euro. Which means tax is 6,642 euro, which is 66.42% of the initial revenue. This is the tax rate for a new startup with 10.000 euro revenue in Greece.

This is, real, madness.

Endless bureaucracy. Copies of your state ID, as if I am not having interaction with the state itself in this adventure. Having a hard physical seal. Moving between state departments because they cannot communicate themselves. Pre-registering, getting confirmation from other departments and then completing registration. Physical books and blocks with multiple copy layers. Of course, taking all this online is a work of fiction.

As for the Part 2: tax. 66% percent tax for 10k revenue? 3,358 euro to live for a year? 200/month = 2,400 euro can only be your rent! If you calculate the tax rate for 20k revenue, it is 60%. It actually goes down, due to the fixed sum for healthcare. [Madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qR0Uke2XNI&t=20).

Essentially, it is not worth it starting up a company in Greece. No; that's not correct. Starting up in Greece takes major courage, infinite patience and a true artistry. I can only applaud those who do it.

This is the situation that we need to overcome in order to have economic growth in Greece; beyond insane bureaucracy and absurd taxes. I honestly see no light at the end of the tunnel.

No hope, at all.
