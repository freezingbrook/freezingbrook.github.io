For yet another time, Greece is at a pre-election time.

Citizens try to decide what they will vote for. The political leaders are even having a debate, to answer on hot topics; questions asked by the most popular TV channels' journalists.

The reason I did not had any urge to watch the debate was because it is clear to me that there is not a single one fairly notable or serious leader to vote for.

The minimum characteristic of a serious person, not getting into consideration the fact that we are talking about *country leaders* are, by my humble opinion, these:

* Not insulting fellow applicants. This is one of the least ethical ways of convincing anyone. If you think some fellow failed, talk about the reasons they failed, how they should have acted and how you would have rightly acted. No serious person personally attacks someone else. In the end, it is a matter of tact.

* Not lying. This does not even need explaining. It is unfathomably obvious that lying is one of the supreme flaws of a leader. How could ever lying suit a long term relation with the people who trust you?

* Respecting each other's opinion and not using violence (i.e. raising your voice) to suppress it. This happens daily in the news and it is shameful for everyone taking part in it.

Beyond these obvious humane points, there are some additional, applying at the country leader level.

* Pointing other's errors. "You created an additional debt of 80bn euros". This is the same argument as above, but I want to illustrate the extra maturity involved. What you should be looking for are ways to improve this country, not stick into each others eye the previous disappointing results; talk about finding ways to improve on this with constructive criticism.

* Having a solid plan. Not one political party in the current Greece's elections is providing a solid plan. Most of them with no plan at all. Leading a country is one of the most, if not *the* most, important job for a citizen. Every leader in Greece goes into this barefoot. The reason for this is that Greece's political scene is dominated by a nepotism the last many years. Leaders come out not with meritocracy, but because they are connected with the proper people.

* Talking clear cut and acting transparently. "It is the right way to act like..." is a usual phrase by political leaders. It is also an unclear phrase; designed to hide the possible outcome of not doing *the right way* and subsequently not being blamed for lying. However, this is a misleading, unnecessary and dishonest way to talk.

These are some pretty specific ways on how Greece's leaders could improve. Moreover, they are some reasons on why our leaders are incapable of actually *leading* the country.
