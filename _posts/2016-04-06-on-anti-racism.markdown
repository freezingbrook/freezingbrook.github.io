"Are you racist? 'No' isn't a good enough answer" â€“ [video](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/jan/13/marlon-james-are-you-racist-video)

The protagonist of the above video claims that being a non-racist is not enough; we need to be anti-racist.

I disagree with this statement and will present my point below, after further analyzing the protagonist's argument.

Firstly, to clarify: being a non-racist means claiming not being a racist instead of claiming to be an anti-racist. This, according to the protagonist has a detrimental effect on the effort to stop racism.

This is because an anti-racist *acts* towards the goal of actually stopping racism. Whereas, a non-racist is generally against racism, but will not strive actively for the prevention of racist actions and/or situations.

The above argument implies directly and claims:
* Racism is a problem. == Thus > we need to stop racism.
* By identifying ourselves as anti-racists and acting as ones, we help towards the solution of the problem of racism.

Racism is the biased animosity towards a different race (as race we can also identify ethnicity). It has many forms, and we are and will be focusing on xenophobia.

Racism causes social unrest. Discrimination creates discontent and tension in the society.

In order to stop racism, we need to find the roots of the problem. Its causes are:
* Fear of the unknown.
* The need to blame someone/something for the society's problems.

To tackle the first, the fear of the unknown, someone must overcome it by proving it false in their mind using objective data, such as that some other people can't be wrong just by being of different ethnicity. And of course, by actually meeting and befriending foreigners.

The second, I think, is a deeper problem. It requires better education and society self-awareness.

The argument, though, of this post is that the notion of solving racism by identifying as anti instead of non is not valid.

This is because, anti proposes an inherent negativity towards racists. However, in order for racists to convert their faith, they must be convinced firstly that racism is bad, and secondly that they are racists.

By being anti, further negativity is cultivated between anti-racists and the accused racists. Negativity results in resentment, hostility and finally hatred. The very same emotion we want to stop.

To stop racists, we must show them the love we want them to have. Understand why they adhere to racist behavior and prove to them there is no reason for it. This cannot be done with attacks that the form of anti proposes. They will lead to aggression and defense from the racist side. And that's why every community fails to peacefully and effectively convince others of their views; because they force them to defense position in which they fail to think clearly and actually understand the points of the other side.
